# Question

## Instruction
Complete the code in template.py for each of the functions corresponding to each of the functions below. Only change params using the `params` dictionary in each function. Do not remove the random_seed functionality of the code. After finishing all exercises test it using example code at the end of the template file and see that you can atleast get corresponding expected accuracies.

### Exercise 1
Train a decision tree, that trains on `X_train` and `y_train` and returns a function which given a `y_test` array returns the predicted values `y_hat_test`.


### Exercise 2
Same as above but with linear SVM.


### Exercise 3
Same as above but with `rbf` SVM. Try the three different values for C as given above. Stick to the one that gives the highest accuracy.
